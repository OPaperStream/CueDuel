## Building

The game is made with [Godot 4.7](https://godotengine.org/).

1. Install Godot 4.7.2 and the Android export templates.
2. Point Godot to an Android SDK (Editor Settings, Export, Android).
3. Export:

```
godot --headless --export-release "Android" build/CueDuel.apk
```

The release keystore is read from the environment variables
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PATH`, `GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_USER` and
`GODOT_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_RELEASE_PASSWORD`.

## Tests

The simulation, rules and AI run without graphics:

```
godot --headless --script tests/sim_test.gd
```

It lets the AI play itself on every level and checks that games finish, pockets work
and the physics is deterministic.
